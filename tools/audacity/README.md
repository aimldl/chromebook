# [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

Audacity is a free open source cross-platform audio editing and recording software which has become the world's most popular app. While the officially supported OS includes Windows, macOS, an Linux, it can be used on ChromeOS as ChromeOS natively supports Debian Linux.

## How to run on Linux and ChromeOS
After [installing Audacity](INSTALL.md), open terminal and run:
```bash
$ audacity
```

## Why I started to use it
There was time that I used Linux, macOS, and Windows. For my deep learning research and daily usage, I needed an audio tool that is more versatile than the OS's default audio player and recorder, yet lighter than serious DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) softwares. Audacity was a good fit because it supports all three OSs. There was no hassle due to different user interface and lack of features. I've been using it for years and quite happy with it. I recently visited Audacity's homepage and found a phrase "Audacity is the world's most popular audio editing and recording app." No wonder. Audacity well-deserves the populatiry.
