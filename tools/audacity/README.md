# [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

Audacity is a free open source cross-platform audio editing and recording software which has become the world's most popular app. While the officially supported OS includes Windows, macOS, an Linux, it can be used on ChromeOS as ChromeOS natively supports Debian Linux.

## How to run on Linux and ChromeOS
After [installing Audacity](INSTALL.md), open terminal and run:
```bash
$ audacity
```

## Why I started to use 
There was a time when I used Linux, macOS, and Windows. For deep learning research and everyday use, I needed audio tools that were more versatile than the OS's default audio player and recorder, but were lighter than serious Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software. Audacity was a good fit as it supports all three OSs. There was no hassle due to significant changes in the user interface. 

I recently visited the Audacity homepage and came across this statement: “Audacity is the world’s most popular audio editing and recording app.” Of course. Audacity deserves the popularity. I have been using it for many years and am very satisfied.
